❗the application configuration (appConfig) that you've defined will be loaded when the application initializes. The Angular APP_INITIALIZER mechanism is specifically designed for running certain logic before the application fully bootstraps (i.e., before the first component is loaded).
❗
❗Here's how it works:
❗
❗Understanding APP_INITIALIZER
❗APP_INITIALIZER is a special Angular provider that allows you to run initialization logic during the application's startup phase. This logic is executed before the application is fully initialized, making it ideal for tasks like:
❗Fetching initial data (e.g., from APIs).
❗Configuring global settings (e.g., localization settings).
❗Checking user authentication.
❗The provider takes a factory function (useFactory) that returns either a promise or an observable. Angular will wait for this promise/observable to resolve before bootstrapping the application.
❗In your case, the appInitializerProviders array defines two initialization functions:
❗
❗TranslateLangServiceFactory: Responsible for loading the language settings.
❗StartupServiceFactory: Handles startup logic (perhaps loading some configuration or initial data).
❗When does APP_INITIALIZER run?
❗First Time the Application Loads: When the application first loads, Angular processes all providers from the configuration (appConfig), including APP_INITIALIZER. For each initializer, it invokes the useFactory function (e.g., TranslateLangServiceFactory, StartupServiceFactory) before fully initializing the app.
❗
❗Waits for Completion: Angular waits for all promises or observables returned by the initializers to resolve. Only after that, the application bootstraps and the root component (typically AppComponent) is loaded.
❗
❗Execution: In your case, the TranslateLangServiceFactory and StartupServiceFactory will be executed. For example:
